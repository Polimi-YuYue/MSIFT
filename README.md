Reviewer #3: The paper proposes a class-imbalanced multi-source information fusion transformer-based neural network for mechanical fault diagnosis with limited data. The proposed method combines the strengths of CNN-based and transformer-based neural networks to capture long-range dependencies and extract valuable fault information. The paper also addresses the challenges of class imbalance and limited data through data-level and algorithm-level strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art methods. However, due to the lack of implementation details and comprehensive assessment, the reviewers concluded that the paper did not meet the acceptance requirements of KNOSYS. The following are the detailed review comments:
1. For the introduction to chapter 1, the author failed to give adequate literature research. The introduction is too long and not well related to the main points of the thesis and fails to highlight the contribution and practical significance of the work done.
2. The paper lacks a detailed description of the implementation details and experimental setup, which makes it difficult to reproduce the study.
3. The evaluation is limited to four different multi-source information datasets, and there is a lack of comparisons with widely-known baselines in the field.
4. Compare the proposed methodology with the transformer-based methodology for 2022-2023 to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology.
5. Please provide additional evaluation and ablation studies, to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
